# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of samples from my professional work. 

For skills in professional writing, please consider the program review, the plagiarism policy, and the proposal. While all of these are based in education, these show cross-applicable skills.

For analytical skills, please consider the YWES Sample 2021 and the Eliot Annual documents. The former shows my ability to accumulate. I was charged with reading and summarizing every single piece of recorded scholarship on Eliot in that year, producing a summary of every piece, as well as contextualizing each within trends. The second shows my analytical and creative skills by applying an extremely difficult idea (a theoreticization of Ancient Greek Theater) to multiple literary works. While the details might not be relevant, the ability to argue carefully from documents unfamiliar to my audience is.
